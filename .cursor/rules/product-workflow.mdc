# Product Workflow Rules

You are assisting with a product development workflow that follows a structured problem-to-product process. This workflow is designed to work with AI-powered engineering tools like Zeroshot, Beads, and Claude.

## Workflow Phases

The product development process follows these phases in order:

1. **Discovery** - Define the problem, research users, analyze competition
2. **Definition** - Create PRD and user stories
3. **Design** - Information architecture, wireframes, design system
4. **Architecture** - ARD, technical design, API specifications
5. **Execution** - Generate tasks for AI execution via Beads/Zeroshot
6. **Release** - Release checklist and launch plan

## Phase-Specific Guidance

### When working on Discovery documents (1-discovery/):
- Focus on the PROBLEM, not solutions
- Ensure success metrics are measurable
- Validate assumptions with evidence
- Document personas with specific details
- Identify non-goals to prevent scope creep

### When working on Definition documents (2-definition/):
- Link every feature back to the problem statement
- Use "As a [persona], I want [action], so that [benefit]" format
- Include acceptance criteria for every user story
- Prioritize ruthlessly: P0 = MVP, P1 = Important, P2 = Nice-to-have

### When working on Design documents (3-design/):
- Reference the PRD requirements explicitly
- Document all states: empty, loading, error, success
- Consider accessibility from the start
- Link wireframes to external tools (Figma, Excalidraw)

### When working on Architecture documents (4-architecture/):
- Include Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major decisions
- Map features to milestones with complexity ratings
- Use TRIVIAL/SIMPLE/STANDARD/CRITICAL complexity levels
- Document API contracts in OpenAPI format

### When working on Execution documents (5-execution/):
- Break features into atomic, executable tasks
- Each task should be completable in one PR
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Map tasks to Zeroshot complexity levels:
  - TRIVIAL: Single file, no validators
  - SIMPLE: 2-3 files, generic validator
  - STANDARD: Multiple files, requirements + code validators
  - CRITICAL: Full validation including security

### When working on Release documents (6-release/):
- Include rollback procedures
- Define go/no-go criteria
- Plan communications (internal and external)
- Set up monitoring before launch

## Document Templates

When creating or editing documents, maintain the existing template structure:
- Keep the metadata header (Status, Author, Date)
- Use consistent heading levels
- Fill in all placeholder sections marked with [brackets]
- Update related document links

## Cross-Reference Pattern

Always maintain links between related documents:
- Problem Statement → PRD → ARD
- User Stories → Features → Tasks
- Wireframes → Design System → Frontend implementation

## AI Execution Readiness

For documents to be ready for AI execution (Zeroshot/Beads):
1. All acceptance criteria must be specific and testable
2. Technical requirements must reference the ARD
3. Dependencies must be clearly stated
4. Complexity level must be assigned

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Starting implementation before problem validation
- Skipping phases (especially Discovery)
- Vague acceptance criteria ("it should work well")
- Missing non-functional requirements (performance, security)
- Not updating documents as understanding evolves
